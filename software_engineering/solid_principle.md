## Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have one,and only one,reason to change.
## Open/Close Principle
* An entity should be open for extension,but closed for modification.
* Extend functionality by adding new code instead of changing existing code.
* Separate the different behaviors, so the system can easily be extended, but never broken.
## Liskov Substitution Principle
* Let F(x) be a property provable about objects x of Type T. Then F(y)
should be true for objects y of Type S where S is subtype of T.
* Any derived class should be able to substitute its parent class without
the consumer knowing about it.
## Interface Segergation Principle
No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
## Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
depend on abstractions.
Able to change an implements easily without altering the high level code.
